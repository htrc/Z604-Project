# Mapper for Hadoop Streaming
# This mapper reads text files line by line, then emits key-value pairs into stdout
# key-value is separated by tab, and the key is a composite key, an example is as below:
#
# 	loc.ark+=13960=t0bv7jp0r[SEP]1876	1
#
# You can test this script locally by:
#
#   cat test.txt | ./mapper.py | sort | ./reducer.py
#
# You can also generate production results locally by modify&run runlocal.sh
