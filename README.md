> This is a course project for Z604 offered by Xiaozhong Liu & Miao Chen in 2014 Spring.

### Abstract
We investigate the temporal resolution of texts in an effort to determine their date of publication and classify each in discrete temporal intervals. We describe and evaluate experiments that incorporate both temporal cues, i.e. explicit dates, pervasiveness of OCR errors, and n-gram text cues. Three separate metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model: Cosine Similarity, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, and Normalized Log-Likelihood Ratio. Initial results indicate that logistic regression plus NLLR classifiers provides effective performance across the twelve intervals.
